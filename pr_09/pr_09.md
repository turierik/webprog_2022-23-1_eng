# Before we continue...

7. Let's look at the "interesting" parts of [last week's](https://github.com/turierik/webprog_2022-23-1_eng/tree/main/pr_08) exercise 7:
   - using two-dimensional arrays to store a data table (e.g. student register)
   - finding the first element that matches a condition
   - using PHP to generate style properties

# Exercises 9

**This week's topic: input processing and validation.**

1. Create a form with a text field and a submit button. When the form is submitted, show the entered value. Make sure that the page does not display warnings/errors if no name was provided (e.g. page is loaded without parameters, no form was submitted yet).
2. Create a form with the given fields and validate the data. If the validation fails, indicate the **exact** condition that failed (e.g. age must be an integer). Show the errors in red near the fields where they occur. Keep the values of the input fields when the page reloads after submitting the form.
    - name: required, must be at least 2 words
    - email: required, valid email format
    - age: required, integer, >= 0
    - gender (radio): required, must be male of female
    - student (checkbox): required
